## Features

- **Fluid Dynamics Simulation**: Simulate the flow of particles around CAD models using advanced fluid dynamics equations like Navier-Stokes, Eulerâ€™s equations, and Bernoulli's principle. Convert CAD models to NumPy arrays for simulation and visualize the results with vector fields.
  
- **Kinematics Simulation**: Analyze projectile motion with and without air resistance, visualize the paths and vector fields, and compare results in real-time. User-defined inputs for velocity, angle, drag, and more.
  

- **Audio Decoding**: Decompose audio files into their constituent sine waves using FFT/DFT, visualize frequency spectra, and analyze the results with user-defined parameters.

- **Interactive GUI**: A modern Electron-based interface allows seamless navigation between modules, with an intuitive home window and back buttons for easy access to different tools.

- **Multi-threading and GPU Acceleration**: Select between single-threaded, multi-threaded, or GPU-accelerated computation for optimal performance.

- **Data Management**: Save and load simulation results in various formats, including Excel, CSV, and SQL databases.
